  "body": "This idea comes from a speech by Neil Harbisson on TEDTalks 2012 which was held in Edinburgh. Artist Neil Harbisson was born completely colour blind, but these days a device attached to his head turns colour into audible frequencies. Instead of seeing a world in grayscale, Harbisson can hear a symphony of colour -- and yes, even listen to faces and paintings. I want to contribute something for them by improving their life experience in this rapid Internet world. Thus, in this final project, I would like to integrate the website design and colour blindness. The research is mainly about the website experience of the colour blindness. \r\nThe topic is Design for the colour blindness: The analysis of optimising the graphic design in the website for the colour blindness. \r\n\r\nQ: \r\nHow to make a website accessible for a colour blind? \r\nA: \r\n1. Designers use the suitable colour for the colour blind (not everyone did). \r\n2. Use a colour blind filter to transfer colours on any website (what I want to do). \r\n\r\nFirstly, I will analyse how to optimise the different display methods to make that content easier for colour blindness to read when web designers building their website. \r\nSecondly, I will build a website to help colour blindness recognise the different colour easier by re-mapping the similar colours in their eyes but the different colours in normal eyes to the different colours in their eyes.",
